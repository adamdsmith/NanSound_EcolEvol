# Appendix 2. Covariate details

We evaluated biophysical covariates (Table 2.1) expected to influence the distribution, abundance, and movements of sea ducks or, more likely, the distribution and availability of their benthic prey (e.g., mollusks and crustaceans); we did not have information related directly to the distribution of preferred prey. Biophysical covariates could be characterized as spatial (varying only among segments), temporal (varying within or among winters, but not among segments) or as spatiotemporal effects (varying among segments and within or among winters). We allowed the effect of bathymetry and relative sea surface temperature to vary over time within a given winter via interactions with day of season.  We also included a survey effort covariate and covariates that were solely a function of segment geographic location, which we used to address potential spatial correlation in the data.  We standardized (i.e., mean centered and scaled) all continuous covariates.  Appendix 3 describes and illustrates the use of an R function to visualize the spatial and temporal distribution of these covariates in Nantucket Sound.
